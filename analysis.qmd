> A 3D VPython simulation that models how voters in a grid-based society shift opinions over time, influenced by their neighbors, long-range interactions, and random noise.


## Overview

This project demonstrates how opinion dynamics can evolve through local and global influences. Each voter is represented as a colored 3D box (red or blue), and their opinions may change based on nearby voters or randomly.

### Key Features:

- Visualized with **VPython** in 3D
- **Red = Conservative**, **Blue = Liberal**, **Yellow = Most Swing-Prone**
- Models **neighbor influence**, **long-range noise**, and **irrationality**
- Includes **interactive pause** and **reset** buttons
- Tracks and displays live voter counts and steps


## Code Repository

> The full code is hosted on GitHub, including the VPython script and instructions for running it in a Jupyter environment.


## Reflections

This simulation taught me how to:
- Translate political behavior into computable models
- Use VPython for dynamic visualization
- Handle interactivity and user controls in simulations
